General strategy:

    1. Divide Chicago into different manageable 'zones'
        - Our data has several different ways of dividing the city
            - Block by block seems to be too specific and requiring a
              map lookup to determine it's location.
            - Lat., Long. location is also very specific, but provides an easy
              way to map our results to Google Maps
            - Communities: too large
            - Beats: perhaps just right (Are they based on pop. density?)

            Proposal:
                Divide the city into rather small, but equal units,
                comprising a several block radius, and use lat/long to
                determine if a location falls in that area.
                QUESTION: Should the units be equal in land area or
                population density.  And if in population density, how
                do we get that information?

    2. Filter our data to only include certain types of crime, so that we
       can provide a map layer of only one type of crime around the city.

    3. Create a block-score based on:
        a. City mean score
        b. Frequency
        c. Temporal proximity
        d. Neighboring blocks
        e. Population density?

    4. Compose a crime index based on the weighted values of all of the
       individual types of crime data.
